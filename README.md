About Me: Hello I’m PaperTree and I’m a 3d Modeler on Roblox. I am experienced at making fun and colorful assets for games. 

Hobbies: I enjoy coding, drawing, and collecting POPs! I have little knowledge in Lua and Python but I still enjoy experimenting with them. I also know HTML and CSS which allows me to make websites.
